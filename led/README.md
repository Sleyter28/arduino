# Basic LED Control with Arduino and GTK 4

This project contains the basic usage of the following programming tools:

- Arduino Uno Board
- C++ Language and GTK 4 Lib to build the user interface
- Assembly language, nasm x86-64 for Linux

## Run Locally
1. Load the led_control.ino sketch onto your Arduino Uno board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Once the sketch is uploaded, connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
3. Run make command (Install all the required dependencies if you haven't already)
4. Execute the program with make run command.
